# React Password Generator

This project is a **React-based Password Generator** that allows users
to create strong, customizable passwords quickly and easily.

## ✨ Features

-   Generate secure passwords with a single click.
-   Options to include **uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers,
    and symbols**.
-   Adjustable password length.
-   **Copy to clipboard** functionality.
-   Responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **React** for building the user interface.
-   **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
-   JavaScript ES6 features like `Math.random()` for random character
    generation.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  User selects password preferences (length, character types).
2.  The generator uses a character pool and randomly picks characters
    based on the chosen settings.
3.  The generated password is displayed and can be copied to the
    clipboard.
